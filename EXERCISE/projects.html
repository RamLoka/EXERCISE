        The following screenshots are from early Java work I completed, involving my first attempt at creating a pseudo AI. I was proud of what I accomplished despite its incomplete status and made solid progress with the time I was given. This console game would simulate knight combat where each turn the players make their own moves. The AI I created would respond based off of your moves and make descisions via a tree of case statements. This isnt the most efficient state for the model, however, with the limit time I was given I felt it was appropriately done. If I were to return to the project I would make it more sophisticated, make the code more readable and the AI desicions more loosely based on player input.

        Below is a work-in-progress: a custom AI tool being developed to better tailor music preferences on Spotify. I was dissatisfied with Spotify's native recommendation system, so I took the initiative to improve it myselfâ€”building upon what already exists.
