                            Hi! My name's <strong>Trentin Brundige</strong> and I'm an aspiring programmer from a small town in Kansas known as Baxter Springs.
                            I've grown up my whole life on video games—proudly having been a member of the Halo 3 LAN parties towards the back end of LAN party popularity.
                            When I was younger, I picked up many artistic hobbies ranging from drawing to creating music.

                            Throughout middle school and high school, as I learned more about myself, I began to dabble in programming through the Python language.
                            Eventually I grew to enjoy and practice programming. Once my junior year rolled around, I had college looming on my horizon and I had little to no plans for my future.
                            Later I would end up receiving a brochure in the mail that explained Neumont College of Computer Science. The college aligned with my needs at the time,
                            being an accelerated program with a focus on technology.

                            Now I plan to grow my knowledge and hopefully receive my degree in AI Engineering. I spend my time studying and playing games with my girlfriend in my free time.
                            Furthermore, my girlfriend and I are working on moving in together and looking for a place to settle down and eventually grow our own family.
                        </p>
